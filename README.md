# Facebook Banner
The included PSD file is the banner I use on my personal Facebook page. It’s a collage of images taken by, and with the courtesy of, Jo-Anne McArthur (from [We Animals](http://weanimals.org/)), with an overlay that reads, “Animals are not here to entertain us, feed us, clothe us, work for us, or be the subjects of research or religious ritual. They’re here with us, not for us.”
